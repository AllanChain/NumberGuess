# num_guess.py
A number guessing game. 
##Rule
- When a single number is in the randomly generated number called `cnum`, but isn't in the right place, it add up as B.
- If is in the right place, they add up as A.
- Your goal is to reach 4A0B, which means you get the totally correct number.
- Example
    - The number generated is 3957
    - You guessed 1367
    - Since both number 3 and 7 is in 3957, and 3 is not in the right place, the result given is 1A1B
